## Internationalization (i18n)

### Current Implementation

- **Primary language:** English only
- All UI text, emails, and admin tools in English
- Translation files structured for future expansion

### Future-Ready Architecture

- Use `next-intl` for i18n routing
- Translation files in `i18n/locales/[locale]/`
- Support planned for:
  - Bengali (bn)
  - Arabic (ar) - RTL support
  - Additional languages as needed
- Text stored as replaceable labels (not hard-coded)
- Build with language file structure (e.g., en.json)

### Implementation Rules

- Never hard-code user-facing text
- Use translation keys for all labels
- Design UI to accommodate text expansion (some languages need more space)
- Plan for RTL layout support (Arabic, Hebrew)

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection

- **Never display publicly:**
  - Church email addresses
  - Contact person names (unless explicitly provided for public display)
  - Admin notes
  - Rejection reasons
- **Private data access:**
  - Only admin can view pending submissions
  - Only admin can view church contact info

### File Security

- Validate all uploaded files (type, size)
- Store files in secure Supabase buckets
- Use signed URLs for private files
- Public files only for approved projects

### Admin Security

- Password-protected admin routes
- Environment variables for sensitive keys
- No admin credentials in code
- Session management for admin access

### API Security

- Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- API keys in environment variables only
- Rate limiting on public endpoints
- CORS configuration for allowed domains

## Performance Requirements

### Loading Speed

- Public pages load under 3 seconds on 4G
- Optimized images (WebP format preferred)
