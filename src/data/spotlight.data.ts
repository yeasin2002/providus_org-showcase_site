    fullDescription:
      "Our Rural Water Access Project is making a significant impact in remote Malawian villages where clean water has been scarce for generations. We work directly with local communities to identify optimal well locations and train residents in maintenance.\n\nSince launching this initiative, we've completed 8 wells serving over 3,000 people. Each well is equipped with hand pumps and surrounded by protective fencing. Community water committees ensure long-term sustainability.\n\nThe impact goes beyond water access - children can now attend school instead of walking hours for water, and waterborne diseases have decreased by 70% in served communities.",
